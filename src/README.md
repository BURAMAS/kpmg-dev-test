For this task i decided to use react beacuse it is the framework i am most familliar with so i wouldnt need to read extensive documentation. I also used the Bootsrap CSS framework. Though i have not used it before when doing some research before starting the project i found that it had a simple table api which allowed for searching and filtering which you requested. I also used leaflet for react in order to generate the map and plot the points required. This was also something I hadnt used before but seamed ideal to solve the problem described in the breif. The UI in the solution is very simple allowing for clear navigation to all the tasks with titles and brief descriptions. A navigation bar can be found at the bottom of evrey page so you can move through all the pages and each page has a dedicated purpose. Any images are located in the assets folder and i attempted to keep the code simple and break it down into reusable components. The solution works for the use cases described in the brief with no errors. I used styled components for a bit more control with the css styling and used blue and white to stay consitent with the logo. I created an axios.js file so that the data can be acessed anywhere by calling the data function and not having to use axios in each individual file. Works on all devices as tested in the google chrome browser. The only fault is the table page styling in the iPad Mini.
